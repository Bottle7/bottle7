# Hello there!

Welcome to my personal repository.

While my background originates in design and frontend development, upon being introduced to the concepts of DevOps and GitOps, I found myself engrossed in the challenge of working on automating development workflows and bridging the gap between technical teams and operations!

Most of my work revolves around creating and automating continuous integration and deployment for products in the BC public service, but I've also been known to dabble in some simple Go and Rust programming on the side.

The most important thing to know about me is that I use Neovim, which I've customized using lua configs. Yeah, I'm that annoying guy.

Anyways, have a peek around and reach out if you have questions.
